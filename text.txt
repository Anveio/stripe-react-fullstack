I want to create html for a home page with five sections: "Welcome, About, My Course, Press, Socials". The"Welcome" section should be split so that theres a left side and a right side. On the left side there should be a header that says "Dalma Daniela" above a nav menu where you can click to scroll to the other sections. On the right side there should be a picture with this src: "https://shoutoutla.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/c-PersonalDalmaLlinas__DalmaCommercialFINAL2_1676830999332.jpg". For the "About Me" section, it should be split into 2 sides: one left, one right. On the left side should be a picture with this source: "https://shoutoutla.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/c-DalmaLlinas__ecaaa1106c9e49e4b8f0ec59d5792046_1676831495797.jpg" and on the right, there should be a header that says "A little about me" and under it should be this text: "I'm an actress, rock singer, songwriter, radio and TV personality, digital entrepreneur, and social media strategist." For the "My Course" section, there should be the header "How to be successful on social media without going viral" and under that should be this text "Do you have social media envy? Want to start a following online but don't know where to start? Are you intimidated by the idea of going viral? Well, I'll teach you how to start your online presence even without going viral." Under that text should be a button that says "Click here to learn more" The next section should be the "Press" section and it should have a header of "check out some of my press" and then below that header should be three image links each with their own titles. The first should have the image "https://shoutoutla.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-logo-black-2.png" that links to "https://shoutoutla.com/meet-dalma-llinas-actress-singer-digital-creator/" and below it says "Shoutout LA"  the second picture should have an image with this source "https://www.laweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/law-logo2x-b-900905.png" that links to "https://www.laweekly.com/top-female-entrepreneurs-to-follow-as-the-year-unfolds/" and has the title "LA Weekly" the third picture and final picture in the "Press" section should have the source "https://nyweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/NY-Weekly-Black.png" that links to "https://nyweekly.com/entertainment/top-10-instagram-accounts-to-follow-2/" and has the title "New York Weekly" That is the end of the "Press" section
